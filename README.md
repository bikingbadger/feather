Local storage option for saving your weight daily and tracking it over time.
Go to [Weight Tracker](https://bikingbadger.github.io/weight-tracker/) and start saving your data over time

## Behind the project

This is a little project for me to test out using Vanilla JS to test out local storage.
Because it's local I don't have to worry about credentials
I will update and optimize this to use the things I am learning during my courses on [Go Make Things](https://gomakethings.com)

At the moment I am using a third party graph. In the future I may try and use my own version.
